# Disease-Prediction
# Problem statement
Build a logistuc regression model for disease prediction
# Approach
1. Data understanding
2. Data cleaning & manipulation
3. Explore the data using descriptive statistics and graphical techniques to understand the distribution and relationships between the variables.
5. Checking for correlations through regression plot,heatmap
6. Splitting data into train & test data
7. Data preprocessing( includes featue scaling of the data)
8. Built logistic regression model,random forest classifier,decision tree classifier
9. Use the model to make predictions on new data.
10. Checking for accuracy of the models' built
